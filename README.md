# A_skyhigh_goal_constructing_a_car
#Rule number 1: in order to constuct a custom car right from scratch you need to get your hands dirty--->we will use a go go!-->help on the go technique. There are a couple of garages we could work at, and of course there are some tools. So we start from zero but I have a solution about #the matterials thing that seems a total headache here in Greece...We can use low cost recycled matterials...it's a strange technic but it can work.
#we can keep up some kind of a diary here with the processes and everything....given the problem(constructing a car) is not unsolvable---> we will eventually fix it if we work hard. I don't expect to be totally easy/ but making a plane for example might be more difficult:)
