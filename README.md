# A_skyhigh_goal_contructing_a_car
#Rule number 1: in order to constuct a custom car right from scratch you need to get your hands dirty--->we will use a go go!-->help on the go technique. There are a couple of garages we could work at, and of course there are enough tools. So we start from zero but it could be worse we could even start from subzero.
#we can keep up some kind of a diary here with the processes and everything....given the problem(constructing a car) is not unsolvable---> we will eventually fix it if we work hard. I don't expect to be totally easy/ but making a plane for example might be more difficult:)
